msgid "There are two manual normalization workflow options. First, the user can do some normalization before bringing any objects into Archivematica. Second, the user can process objects through to Ingest and then choose to do manual normalization on some of the objects. Below are the workflow steps to test each of these options."

msgid "In either option, it is also possible to add PREMIS event detail metadata about the manual normalization event. See below for details."

msgid "Option 1: Manual normalization prior to transfer to Archivematica"
msgstr ""

#: ../user-manual/ingest/manual-normalization.rst:22
msgid "The manual normalization feature allows the user to prepare transfers that already contain manually normalized files. The user adds a /manualNormalization folder and its subdirectories to the transfer prior to processing. Archivematica recognizes that this folder already exists and will not add one during processing. This workflow requires that there must be a one-to-one relationship between the transfer and the SIP."
msgstr ""

#: ../user-manual/ingest/manual-normalization.rst:29
msgid "1. First, create your transfers with a structure that mimics the one in this sample. Name the /topDirectory whatever you want (you can still change this when you upload the transfer to the dashboard) and place the original files in it. /manualNormalization contains two directories, /access and /preservation which include in them the files you've already normalized for access and/or preservation prior to transfer. In the sample shown here, file1.tga has a manually normalized preservation version (file1.tif) and a manually normalized access version (file1.jpg). Note that the filenames, in this instance \"file1\", MUST match in order for Archivematica to recognize the links between the original .tga file and the manually normalized preservation and access versions."

If you choose to review normalization results prior to accepting, you will find your /manualNormalization folder and its contents in the objects directory of your transfer, with it's /access and/or /preservation folders and their content intact. If you're happy with the results here, approve normalization."

If you download the AIP from the review tab by simply clicking on the file with the 7z extension, you can download, unzip and view your AIP in your file browser. Your AIP will consist of a top level folder with the name you assigned plus a UUID. In that folder, you'll find a /data folder which contains your objects for preservation, logs, thumbnails and the METS xml. That data folder will contain your originals and normalized files, and the METS will include PREMIS events with \"manual normalization\" noted in the eventDetail of the appropriate normalization events. A discussion of the overall AIP structure can be found here: :ref:`AIP structure <aip-structure>`. Additionally, you might note that the manualNormalization folder and subfolders used during the manual normalization workflow have been deleted once normalization was approved rather than being packaged into the AIP."
