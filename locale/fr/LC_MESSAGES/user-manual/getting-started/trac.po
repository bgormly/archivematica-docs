"The home page of the site provides an overview of an organization's "
"efforts to document its evidence for meeting the requirements of the "
"CCSDS Audit and Certification of Trustworthy Digital Repositories "
"`checklist <http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/652x0m1.pdf>`_ "
"that was approved as ISO 16363 and is based on Trustworthy Repositories "
"Audit and Certification (TRAC): Criteria and Checklist that was released "
"in January 2007. A TRAC review is a self-assessment method for an "
"organization to demonstrate good practice and conformance as a trusted "
"digital repository to its designated communities and prepare for a peer "
"review or other external audit. In many organizations, responsibilities "
"for TRAC compliance are distributed throughout the organization, with "
"specific units and committees having certain responsibilities for each "
"requirement."
