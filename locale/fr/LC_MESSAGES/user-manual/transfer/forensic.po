"If you are processing disk images, you will want to adjust the "
"Archivematica default configuration options in the Administration tab of "
"the dashboard for some decision points in the workflow. Archivematica "
"default is to extract content from any packages, which includes forensic "
"image formats as well as compressed content like zip files, and to then "
"delete the package itself (though the metadata and logs for the package "
"are retained in the metadata and logs). To make these decisions in the "
"dashboard processing workflow:"
