"Archivematica anticipates that a number of different types of errors can "
"occur during processing. Some of them will result in processing being "
"halted and the transfer or SIP being moved to the failed directory in the"
" file browser. For others, processing can continue: for example, a "
"normalization failure is reported and the user is given the opportunity "
"to continue processing the SIP."

"Someone may have had the same problem before and been offered a solution."
" If you do not find the answer there, feel free to ask us a question. The"
" best questions to the list include as much information as possible about"
" the error. This means offering us information about the system(s) you're"
" using, the content of your transfer(s), and copying the task information"
" (click on the cog icon on the same line as the micro-service job where "
"the error occurred) and show arguments data output. See task information "
