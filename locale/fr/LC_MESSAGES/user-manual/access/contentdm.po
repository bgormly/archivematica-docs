"If there are both Dublin Core and non-Dublin Core fields in metadata.csv,"
" Archivematica will look for \"custom\" (non-Dublin Core) field names in "
"the metadata.csv file file and create a tab delimited file based on those"
" fields. This allows the operator to use the field names as they appear "
"exactly as they do in the CONTENTdm collection, which eases the field "
"matching in Project Client. It is also recommended that you enter the "
"non-Dublin Core fields in the same order as in your CONTENTdm collection."
" However, if metadata.csv contains *only* Dublin Core namespaced fields, "
"Archivematica will create the tab delimited file using those fieldnames, "
"stripping out the dc namespace. For example, ``dc.title`` will become "
"``title``."
